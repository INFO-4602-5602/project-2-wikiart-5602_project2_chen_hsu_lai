        We segmented our analysis mostly by category and time. In the first part of our analysis, we looked at average ratings and annotation ratio by category, then average ratings and annotation ratio by time. In the second part of our analysis, we looked into average rating of top K artists. <br><br>

        In addition to ratings by time, annotation ratio, and artists, we wanted to find out more about the portraits by investigating the face to body+face ratio. We also wanted to find out the general trend in titles across all portraits by generating a word cloud. <br><br>

        Below two plots show average rating and average annotation ratio by category. (describe average rating by category).
        (insert average rating by category plot) <br><br>

        (describe average annotation ratio by category plot). 
        (insert average annotation ratio by category plot) <br><br>

        (maybe make a comment/statement about analysis by category) <br><br>

        We now look at analysis by time, specifically century. (describe average rating by century)
        (insert average rating by century plot) <br><br>

        (describe average annotation ratio by century) 
        (insert average annotation ratio by century plot) <br><br>

        In the second part of the analysis, we take a closer look at the artists and their portraits. Here we show the average rating of top K artists since they are too many artists to be displayed. We removed any artists that has a rating below the average rating of all artists. (describe average rating by artists)
        (insert average rating by artist plot) <br><br>

        We also wanted to find out if a face to face+body ratio pattern exists in the portraits. Below shows a plot of the face to total (as represented by face+body) proportion by category. (describe face / (body + face) proportion by category)
        (insert face / (body + face) proportion by category plot) <br><br>

        Finally, we wanted to find out a general overview of how titles are generated. We generated a word cloud using all of the portrait titles. (describe word cloud)
        (insert word cloud)
